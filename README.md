Galaxy Generator with Black Hole Gravity
Built with Three.js + GSAP + Unreal Bloom

This is a personal creative experiment where I built an interactive galaxy simulator in Three.js, and took it a step further with a black hole that pulls in stars dynamically. All of it is customizable through a live GUI.

I wanted something that felt alive and reactive â€” inspired by space games, data cores, and those trippy visuals youâ€™d see in sci-fi UIs.

ðŸ”§ What You Can Do
Generate millions of particles that form spiraling galaxy arms

Adjust galaxy settings like spin, branches, randomness, and radius

Toggle a black hole that sucks in stars from all directions using force-based movement

Switch colors in real-time using GUI controls

Trigger a warp jump camera animation into the black holeâ€™s core

Add cinematic vibes with UnrealBloomPass, fog, glow, and ACES tone mapping

ðŸ§  Tech Stack
Three.js

GSAP for camera animations

lil-gui for live controls

Postprocessing (EffectComposer + UnrealBloomPass)

ðŸš€ Getting Started
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
npm run dev
Note: Youâ€™ll need to use a local server (like Vite or Live Server) to run this â€” WebGL needs it.
