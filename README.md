# ðŸŒŒ Galaxy Generator + Black Hole Visualizer  
Built with Three.js, GSAP, and Postprocessing  

This started as a simple galaxy particle generator and evolved into a fully interactive, animated scene â€” complete with a glowing black hole that sucks in stars from all directions.

Everything is tweakable live through a GUI. It's like building a little sci-fi universe from scratch with sliders.

## âœ¨ Features

- Procedurally generated galaxy with adjustable:
  - Star count
  - Radius
  - Spin
  - Branches
  - Randomness
  - Inside and outside colors
- Black hole animation that simulates gravity using directional force
- Toggleable camera animation (warp jump into the black hole core)
- Glowing crystal core using physical material and bloom
- Organized GUI with separate folders for galaxy, colors, and black hole controls
- Fog, bloom, and tone mapping for that cinematic glow

## ðŸŽ® Controls

Open the GUI and adjust values in real-time:
- `Galaxy Settings`: Particle count, shape, randomness
- `Colors`: Inside and outside color of the galaxy
- `Black Hole Controls`: Trigger warp jump or activate black hole gravity mode
